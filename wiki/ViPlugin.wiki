List some useful vi plug-in

= Contents =

== 1. bufexplorer.vim ==

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42

=== Usage Tips ===

{{{
\be
}}} 
normal open

{{{
\bs
}}}
force horizontal split open

{{{
\bv
}}}
force vertical split open

Because I have used tabbed buffer view, ':bn' ':bp' (mapped to < tab> and '`'), so '\bs' can be only used when there are too much buffer opened.

== 2. taglist.vim ==

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273

=== Usage Tips ===

{{{
:Tlist
:TlistTroggle
}}}
Either of above commands can troggle the taglist. In my option.vim, I have put the taglist windows on right side.
_ctrl+ww_ can change between each windows. In the taglist windows _o_ will open the file in new window, and _enter_ will open the file in current window.
I have mapped the _:TlistTroggle_ to _< F12>_.

== 3. ALIGN ==
